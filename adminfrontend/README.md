# React Modern Boilerplate

When first getting started with a new react app you will need to install all of the annoying dependencies and make the 'boilerplate' react-dom setup.
This boilerplate project will get you up and running with modern dependencies and typescript so you can focus on the code.

## What Modern Dependencies Is Included?
- [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start): Allows routing in a SPA context aswell as a NonSPA Context
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics): Allows you to do CSS in components to reduce coupling.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): All modern reactapps should force typescript as it reduces logic errors.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/): Allows state management in a nice easy format, also gives you nice dev tools in a non production context.
- [Node SASS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass): Allows you to write css in a SCSS file, which will compile down to a efficient CSS file in production.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios): Modern javascript HTTP requests and GraphQL.
