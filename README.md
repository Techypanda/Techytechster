# Techytechster

Please visit https://techytechster.com to see the public static site.
This repository is the sourcecode for my apis and static site, if you wish to fork/use this as a base for something else feel free to.

## What does it run on?

I am a AWS shill so everything here runs on my AWS.

## APIs

All my backend can be found in the API directory, it is written in Golang and I always lean towards serverless solutions so its likely to be lambda/ecs where it has to be.

## Techytechster.com Frontend

The frontend for the public static site can be found at https://techytechster.com, the code is in the techytechsterfrontend directory, its written in React and uses typescript with good programming practices being followed.

## Dashboard Showing Static Site & API Status

- Currently the only metric I have is page visits from IP Addresses.
